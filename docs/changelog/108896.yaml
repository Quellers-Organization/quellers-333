  title: Introduce logs index mode as Tech Preview
  body: |-
    This change introduces a new index mode named: `logs`.
    When the new index mode is enabled then the following storage savings features are enabled automatically:
    * Synthetic source, which omits storing the _source. When _source or part of it is requested it is synthesized on the fly at runtime.
    * Indexing sorting. By default indices are sorting by `host.name` and `@timestamp` fields at index time. This can be overwritten if other sorting fields yield better compression rate.
    * Enable more space efficient compressions for fields with doc values enabled. These are the same codecs used
      when `time_series` index mode is enabled.

    The `index.mode` index setting to `logs` should be configured in index templates or defined when creating a plain index.
    Benchmarks and other tests have shown that logs data sets use around 2.5 times less storage with the new index mode enabled compared to not configuring it.
    The new `logs` index mode is a tech preview feature.
