  title: Enable ZStandard compression for stored fields with
  body: |-
    Before DEFLATE compression was used to compress stored fields in indices with index.codec index setting set to
    best_compression, with this change ZStandard is used as compression algorithm to stored fields for indices with
    index.codec index setting set to best_compression. Experiments have shown that ZStandard offers lower storage usage
    (upto ~12%) and higher indexing throughput (upto 14%) compared to DEFLATE.
