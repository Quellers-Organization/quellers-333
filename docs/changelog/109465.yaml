  title: Switch to the CLDR locale database
  body: |-
    The COMPAT locale data provider has been removed in JDK23. This means Elasticsearch
    needs to switch to the JDK-provided CLDR locale database. For consistency, this PR changes
    the locale database for all JDK versions.

    There are several significant differences between the COMPAT locale database and CLDR.
    To ease migration, a shim has been added to maintain the existing era, day-of-week, month,
    and am/pm names from COMPAT, where they differ from CLDR.

    To continue to use the COMPAT locale database on previous Java versions,
    set ES_CLI_OPTS="-Dcompat.locales=true", but this will not work on Java version 23 and above.
