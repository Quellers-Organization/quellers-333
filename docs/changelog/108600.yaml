  title: "Prevent DLS/FLS if `replication` is assigned"
  area: REST API
  details: For cross-cluster API keys, {es} no longer allows specifying document-level security (DLS)
    or field-level security (FLS) in the `search` field, if `replication` is also specified.
    {es} also blocks the use of any existing cross-cluster API keys that meet this condition.
  impact: Remove any document-level security (DLS) or field-level security (FLS) from `search` field for
    cross-cluster API keys that also have a `replication` field, or create two separate keys, one for search and for
    replication.
