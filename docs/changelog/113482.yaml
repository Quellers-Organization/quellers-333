  title: The 'persian' analyzer has stemmer by default
  area: Analysis
  details: >-
    Lucene 10 has added a final stemming step to its PersianAnalyzer that we 
    expose as 'persian' analyzer. Existing indices will keep the old
    non-stemming behaviour while new indices will see the updated behaviour with
    added stemming.
    Users that want to maintain the non-stemming behaviour need to define their
    own analyzer as outlines in
    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/analysis-lang-analyzer.html#persian-analyzer.
    Users that want to use the new stemming behaviour for existing indices will
    have to reindex their data.
  impact: >-
    Indexing with the 'persian' analyzer will produce slightly different token.
    Users should check if this impacts their search results. If they want to
    maintain the legacy non-stemming behaviour they can define their own
    analyzer equivalent as explained in 
    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/analysis-lang-analyzer.html#persian-analyzer.
