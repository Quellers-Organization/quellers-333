== Index mode

preview::["The `logs` index mode is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features."]

The `index.mode` setting is used to control settings applied in specific domains like ingestion of time series data or logs.
Different mutually exclusive modes exist, which are used to apply settings or default values controlling indexing of documents, sorting and other parameters
whose value affects indexing or query performances.
