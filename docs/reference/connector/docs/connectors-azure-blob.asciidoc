[%collapsible]
===============

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-availability-prerequisites]
=== Availability and prerequisites

This connector is available as a *native connector* on Elastic Cloud, as of *8.9.1*.

To use this connector natively in Elastic Cloud, satisfy all <<native-connectors-prerequisites,native connector requirements>>.

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-compatability]
=== Compatibility

This connector has not been tested with Azure Government.
Therefore we cannot guarantee that it will work with Azure Government endpoints.
For more information on Azure Government compared to Global Azure, refer to the
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/compare-azure-government-global-azure[official Microsoft documentation^].

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-usage]
=== Usage

To use this connector as a *native connector*, see <<native-connectors>>.

For additional operations, see <<connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-configuration]
=== Configuration

The following configuration fields are required to set up the connector:

Account name::
Name of Azure Blob Storage account.

Account key::
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal[Account key^] for the Azure Blob Storage account.

Blob endpoint::
Endpoint for the Blob Service.

Containers::
List of containers to index.
`*` will index all containers.

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-documents-syncs]
=== Documents and syncs

The connector will fetch all data available in the container.

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted. (Self-managed connectors can use the <<connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.)
* Permissions are not synced.
**All documents** indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to **all users with access** to that Elastic Deployment.
====

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-sync-types]
==== Sync types

<<connectors-sync-types-full,Full syncs>> are supported by default for all connectors.

This connector also supports <<connectors-sync-types-incremental,incremental syncs>>.

[discrete#connectors-azure-sync-rules]
=== Sync rules

<<sync-rules-basic,Basic sync rules>> are identical for all connectors and are available by default.

Advanced sync rules are not available for this connector in the present version.
Currently filtering is controlled via ingest pipelines.

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-content-extraction]
=== Content extraction

See <<connectors-content-extraction>>.

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-known-issues]
=== Known issues

This connector has the following known issues:

* *`lease data` and `tier` fields are not updated in Elasticsearch indices*
+
This is because the blob timestamp is not updated.
Refer to https://github.com/elastic/connectors-python/issues/289[Github issue^].

[%collapsible]
===============

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-client-availability-prerequisites]
=== Availability and prerequisites

This connector is available as a self-managed *connector client*.
This connector client is compatible with Elastic versions *8.6.0+*.
To use this connector, satisfy all <<build-connector,connector client requirements>>.

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-client-compatability]
=== Compatibility

This connector has not been tested with Azure Government.
Therefore we cannot guarantee that it will work with Azure Government endpoints.

[discrete#connectors-{service-name-stub}-create-connector-client]
=== Create {service-name} connector

include::_connectors-create-client.asciidoc[]

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-client-usage]
=== Usage

To use this connector as a *connector client*, see <<build-connector>>
For additional usage operations, see <<connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-client-configuration]
=== Configuration

[TIP]
====
When using the <<build-connector, connector client>> workflow, initially these fields will use the default configuration set in the {connectors-python}/connectors/sources/azure_blob_storage.py[connector source code^].
These are set in the `get_default_configuration` function definition.

These configurable fields will be rendered with their respective *labels* in the Kibana UI.
Once connected, you'll be able to update these values in Kibana.
====

The following configuration fields are required to set up the connector:

`account_name`::
Name of Azure Blob Storage account.

`account_key`::
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal[Account key^] for the Azure Blob Storage account.

`blob_endpoint`::
Endpoint for the Blob Service.

`containers`::
List of containers to index.
`*` will index all containers.

`retry_count`::
Number of retry attempts after a failed call.
Default value is `3`.

`concurrent_downloads`::
Number of concurrent downloads for fetching content.
Default value is `100`.

`use_text_extraction_service`::
Requires a separate deployment of the <<connectors-content-extraction-local,Elastic Text Extraction Service>>. Requires that ingest pipeline settings disable text extraction.
Default value is `False`.

[discrete#connectors-azure-blob-client-testing]
=== End-to-end testing

The connector framework enables operators to run functional tests against a real data source.
Refer to <<build-connector-testing>> for more details.

To perform E2E testing for the Azure Blob Storage connector, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ make ftest NAME=azure_blob_storage
----

For faster tests, add the `DATA_SIZE=small` flag:

[source,shell]
----
make ftest NAME=azure_blob_storage DATA_SIZE=small
