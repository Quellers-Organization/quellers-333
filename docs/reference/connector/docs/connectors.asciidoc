A _connector_ is a type of https://www.elastic.co/integrations/data-integrations[Elastic integration^] that syncs data from an original data source to an *Elasticsearch index*. 
Connectors enable you to create _searchable_, read-only replicas of your data sources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These connectors are focused on general content, that is non-timestamped data.
Refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-cloud-ingest-data.html if you're interested in ingesting timestamped data.
====

Connectors extract the original files, records, or objects; and transforms them into Elasticsearch documents.

Many connectors are available out-of-the-box on Elastic Cloud.
You can also access the source code for these (and additional) connectors, and run them on your own infrastructure.

* **Native connectors** are available directly within your Elastic Cloud deployment.
* **Connector clients** are self-managed on your own infrastructure.

== Native connectors {ess-icon} (_managed service_)

_Native connectors_ are available directly within your Elastic Cloud deployment, as a managed service.
No additional infrastructure is required.

See <<native-connectors>> for details on how to configure and use native connectors.

== Connector clients (_self-managed_)

Connector clients enable you to run connectors locally on your own infrastructure.
This means you can try out new connectors before they are available natively within Elastic Cloud, and/or customize existing connectors.

See <<build-connector>> for details on how to deploy connector clients.

[discrete#connectors-overview-framework]
== Connector framework

All Elastic connectors are built using our Python connector framework.
The source code is available in the {connectors-python}[`elastic/connectors`] repository on GitHub.

The connector framework is available for developers to customize existing connector clients or build their own connectors.
Refer to <<connectors-framework>> for details.
