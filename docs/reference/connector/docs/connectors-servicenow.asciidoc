* ServiceNow "San Diego"
* ServiceNow "Rome"
* ServiceNow "Utah"
* ServiceNow "Vancouver"

[discrete#connectors-servicenow-configuration]
===== Configuration

The following configuration fields are required to set up the connector:

ServiceNow URL::
The host URL of the ServiceNow instance.

Username::
The username of the account used for ServiceNow.

Password::
The password of the account used for ServiceNow.

Comma-separated list of services::
Comma-separated list of services to fetch data from ServiceNow. If the value is `*`, the connector will fetch data from the list of basic services provided by ServiceNow:
- link:https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/roles/concept/user.html[User]
- link:https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-it-service-management/page/product/incident-management/concept/c_IncidentManagement.html[Incident]
- link:https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-servicenow-platform/page/use/service-catalog-requests/task/t_AddNewRequestItems.html[Requested Item]
- link:https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-customer-service-management/page/product/customer-service-management/task/t_SearchTheKnowledgeBase.html[Knowledge]
- link:https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-it-service-management/page/product/change-management/task/t_CreateAChange.html[Change Request]
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have configured a custom service, the `*` value will not fetch data from the basic services above by default. In this case you'll need to mention these service names explicitly.
====
Default value is `*`. Examples:
+
  - `User, Incident, Requested Item, Knowledge, Change Request`
  - `*`

Enable document level security::
Restrict access to documents based on a user's permissions.
Refer to <<connectors-servicenow-dls>> for more details.

[discrete#connectors-servicenow-documents-syncs]
===== Documents and syncs

All services and records the user has access to will be indexed according to the configurations provided.
The connector syncs the following ServiceNow object types:

* Records
* Attachments

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted. (Self-managed connectors can use the <<connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.)
* Permissions are not synced by default. Refer to <<connectors-servicenow-dls>> for more details.
====

[discrete#connectors-servicenow-sync-types]
====== Sync types

<<connectors-sync-types-full,Full syncs>> are supported by default for all connectors.

This connector also supports <<connectors-sync-types-incremental,incremental syncs>>.

[discrete#connectors-servicenow-dls]
===== Document level security

<<dls, Document level security (DLS)>> ensures identities and permissions set in ServiceNow are maintained in Elasticsearch.
This enables you to restrict and personalize read-access users and groups have to documents in this index.
Access control syncs ensure this metadata is kept up to date in your Elasticsearch documents.

The ServiceNow connector supports roles for access control lists (ACLs) to enable document level security in {es}. 
For default services, connectors use the following roles to find users who have access to documents.

|===
| Service | Roles 

| User | `admin` 

| Incident | `admin`, `sn_incident_read`, `ml_report_user`, `ml_admin`, `itil` 

| Requested Item | `admin`, `sn_request_read`, `asset`, `atf_test_designer`, `atf_test_admin` 

| Knowledge | `admin`, `knowledge`, `knowledge_manager`, `knowledge_admin` 

| Change Request | `admin`, `sn_change_read`, `itil` 
|===

For services other than these defaults, the connector iterates over access controls with `read` operations and finds the respective roles for those services.

[NOTE]
====
The ServiceNow connector does not support scripted and conditional permissions.
====

[discrete#connectors-servicenow-sync-rules]
===== Sync rules

<<sync-rules-basic,Basic sync rules>> are identical for all connectors and are available by default.

[discrete#connectors-servicenow-sync-rules-advanced]
====== Advanced sync rules

[NOTE]
====
A <<connectors-sync-types-full, full sync>> is required for advanced sync rules to take effect.
====

Advanced sync rules are defined through a source-specific DSL JSON snippet.

To perform E2E testing for the ServiceNow connector, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ make ftest NAME=servicenow
----

Generate performance reports using the following flag: `PERF8=yes`.
Toggle test data set size between SMALL, MEDIUM and LARGE with the argument `DATA_SIZE=`.
By default, it is set to `MEDIUM`.

Users do not need to have a running Elasticsearch instance or a ServiceNow source to run this test.
Docker Compose manages the complete setup of the development environment.
