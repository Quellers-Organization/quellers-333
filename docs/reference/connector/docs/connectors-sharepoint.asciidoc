For additional operations, see <<connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#connectors-sharepoint-compatability]
=== Compatibility

The following SharePoint Server versions are compatible:

* SharePoint 2013
* SharePoint 2016
* SharePoint 2019

[discrete#connectors-sharepoint-configuration]
=== Configuration

The following configuration fields are required to set up the connector:

`username`::
The username of the account for the SharePoint Server instance.

`password`::
The password of the account.

`host_url`::
The server host url where the SharePoint Server instance is hosted. Examples:
* `https://192.158.1.38:8080`
* `https://<tenant_name>.sharepoint.com`

`site_collections`::
Comma-separated list of site collections to fetch from SharePoint Server. Examples:
* `collection1`
* `collection1, collection2`

`ssl_enabled`::
Whether SSL verification will be enabled.
Default value is `False`.

`ssl_ca`::
Content of SSL certificate needed for SharePoint Server.
Keep this field empty, if `ssl_enabled` is set to `False`.
+
Example certificate:
+
----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIID+jCCAuKgAwIBAgIGAJJMzlxLMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMHoxCzAJBgNVBAYT
...
7RhLQyWn2u00L7/9Omw=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

`retry_count`::
The number of retry attempts after a failed request to the SharePoint Server instance. Default value is `3`.

`use_document_level_security`::
Toggle to enable <<dls, Document level security (DLS)>>.
When enabled, full syncs will fetch access control lists for each document and store them in the `_allow_access_control` field. Access control syncs fetch users' access control lists and store them in a separate index.
+
Once enabled, the following granular permissions toggles will be available:
+
** *Fetch unique list permissions*: Enable this option to fetch unique *list* permissions. If this setting is disabled a list will inherit permissions from its parent site.
** *Fetch unique list item permissions*: Enable this option to fetch unique *list item* permissions. If this setting is disabled a list item will inherit permissions from its parent site.
+
[NOTE]
====
If left empty the default value `true` will be used for these granular permissions toggles.
Note that these settings may increase sync times.
====

[discrete#connectors-sharepoint-documents-syncs]
=== Documents and syncs

The connector syncs the following SharePoint object types:

* Sites and Subsites
* Lists
* List Items and its attachment content
* Document Libraries and its attachment content(include Web Pages)

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted by default. Use the <<connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.
* Permissions are not synced. **All documents** indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to **all users with access** to that Elasticsearch Index.
====

[discrete#connectors-sharepoint-sync-types]
==== Sync types

<<connectors-sync-types-full,Full syncs>> are supported by default for all connectors.

This connector also supports <<connectors-sync-types-incremental,incremental syncs>>.

[discrete#connectors-sharepoint-document-level-security]
=== Document level security

Document level security (DLS) enables you to restrict access to documents based on a userâ€™s permissions.
Refer to <<connectors-sharepoint-configuration,configuration>> on this page for how to enable DLS for this connector.

[NOTE]
====
Refer to <<dls-e2e-guide, DLS in Search Applications>> to learn how to ingest data from a connector with DLS enabled, when building a search application.
The example uses SharePoint _Online_ as the data source, but the same steps apply to every connector.
====

[discrete#connectors-sharepoint-sync-rules]
=== Sync rules

<<sync-rules-basic,Basic sync rules>> are identical for all connectors and are available by default.

Advanced sync rules are not available for this connector in the present version.
