This tutorial show you how to use the semantic text feature to perform semantic
search on your data.

Semantic text simplifies the {infer} workflow by providing {infer} at ingestion
time and sensible default values automatically. You don't need to define certain
settings and parameters or create {infer} ingest pipelines.

The recommended way to perform semantic search in the {stack} is following the
semantic text workflow. However, if you need more control over the settings, you
can still use the complete {infer} workflow (refer to 
<<semantic-search-inference,this tutorial>> to review the process).

This tutorial uses the `elser` service for demonstration but you can use any
service and their supported models offered by the {infer-cap} API.
