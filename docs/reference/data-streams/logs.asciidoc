== Logs data stream (LogsDS)

You can use a LogsDS to store log data more efficiently. In our benchmarks,
log data stored in a LogsDS used ~2.5 times less disk space than a regular data
stream. The exact impact will vary per data set. The main benefit from using LogsDS is reduced storage.

The following features are enabled in a logs data stream:

* <<synthetic-source,Synthetic source>>, which omits storing the _source. When _source or part of it is requested it is synthesized on the fly at runtime.

* Index sorting. By default indices are sorted by `host.name` and `@timestamp` fields at index time, which can be overwritten.

* Enable more space efficient compression for fields with doc values enabled.

=== How to use a LogsDS

Enabling LogsDS only requires configuring the `index.mode` setting to `logs`. For example like this is done in this template:

[source,console]
----
PUT _index_template/my-index-template
{
  "index_patterns": ["logs-*"],
  "data_stream": { },
  "template": {
     "settings": {
        "index.mode": "logs" <1>
     }
  },
  "priority": 500 <2>
}
----

<1> The index mode setting
<2> Defining a priority to avoid other index templates with overlapping index patterns potentially overriding the settings.

After this data can be indexed like in any other data stream.
