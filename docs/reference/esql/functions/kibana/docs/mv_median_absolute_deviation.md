### MV_MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION
Converts a multivalued field into a single valued field containing the median absolute deviation.

```
ROW values = [0, 2, 5, 6]
| EVAL median_absolute_deviation = MV_MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(values), median = MV_MEDIAN(values)
```
Note: If the field has an even number of values, the medians will be calculated as the average of the middle two values. If the column is not floating point, the averages round towards 0.
