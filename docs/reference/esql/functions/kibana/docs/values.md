### VALUES
Returns all values in a group as a multivalued field. The order of the returned values isn't guaranteed.
If you need the values returned in order use <<esql-mv_sort>>.

WARNING: This can use a significant amount of memory and ES|QL doesn't yet
         grow aggregations beyond memory. So this aggregation will work until
         it is used to collect more values than can fit into memory. Once it
         collects too many values it will fail the query with
         a <<circuit-breaker-errors, Circuit Breaker Error>>.

```
  FROM employees
| EVAL first_letter = SUBSTRING(first_name, 0, 1)
| STATS first_name=MV_SORT(VALUES(first_name)) BY first_letter
| SORT first_letter
```
