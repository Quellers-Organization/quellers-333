Shard recovery is the process of initializing a shard copy, such as restoring a
primary shard from a snapshot or syncing a replica shard from a primary shard.
When a shard recovery completes, the recovered shard is available for search
and indexing.

Recovery automatically occurs during the following processes:

* Node startup or failure. This type of recovery is called a local store recovery.
* Replication of primary shards to replica shards.
* Relocation of a shard to a different node in the same cluster.
* A <<snapshots-restore-snapshot,snapshot restore>> operation.
* A <<indices-clone-index,clone>>, <<indices-shrink-index,shrink>>, or
<<indices-split-index,split>> operation.
