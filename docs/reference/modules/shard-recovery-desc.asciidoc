Shard recovery is the process of initializing a shard copy, such as restoring a
primary shard from a snapshot or syncing a replica shard from a primary shard.
When a shard recovery completes, the recovered shard is available for search
and indexing.

Recovery automatically occurs during the following processes:

* Node startup. This type of recovery is called a local store recovery.
* Primary shard replication.
* Relocation of a shard to a different node in the same cluster.
* <<snapshots-restore-snapshot,Snapshot restore>> operation.
* <<indices-clone-index,Clone>>, <<indices-shrink-index,shrink>>, or
<<indices-split-index,split>> operation.
