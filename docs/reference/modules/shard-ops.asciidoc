=== Shard allocation, relocation, and recovery

Each <<documents-indices,index>> in Elasticsearch is divided into one or more <<scalability,shards>>, each of which acts as a copy of the index and can be replicated across multiple <<modules-node,nodes>> to protect against hardware failures.

include::{es-ref-dir}/primaries-replicas-desc.asciidoc[]

Over the course of normal operation, Elasticsearch allocates shards to nodes, relocates shards across nodes to balance the cluster, and recovers shards to initialize new copies. In this topic, you'll learn how these operations work and how you can control them.

TIP: To learn about optimizing the number and size of shards in your cluster, refer to <<size-your-shards,Size your shards>>. To learn about how read and write operations are replicated across shards, refer to <<docs-replication,Reading and writing documents>>.

==== Shard allocation

include::{es-ref-dir}/modules/shard-allocation-desc.asciidoc[]

By default, the primary and replica shards for an index can be allocated to any node in the cluster, and may be relocated to rebalance the cluster. 

===== Adjust shard allocation settings

You can control how shards are allocated using the following settings:

- <<modules-cluster,Cluster-level shard allocation settings>>: Use these settings to control how shards are allocated and balanced across the entire cluster. For example, you might want to allocate nodes availability zones, or prevent certain nodes from being used so you can perform maintenance.

- <<index-modules-allocation,Index-level shard allocation settings>>: Use these settings to control how the shards for a specific index are allocated. For example, you might want to allocate an index to a node in a specific data tier, or to an node with specific attributes.

===== Monitor shard allocation

If a shard is unassigned, it means that the shard is not allocated to any node in the cluster. This can happen if there are not enough nodes in the cluster to allocate the shard, or if the shard can't be allocated to any node that satisfies the shard allocation filtering rules.

You can use the following APIs to monitor shard recovery:

- <<cluster-allocation-explain,Cluster allocation explain>>
- <<cat-allocation,cat allocation>>

==== Shard recovery

include::{es-ref-dir}/modules/shard-recovery-desc.asciidoc[]

===== Adjust shard recovery settings

To control how shards are recovered, for example the number of recoveries that can happen concurrently, the resources that can be used by recovery operations, and which indices should be prioritized for recovery, you can adjust the following settings: 

- <<recovery,Index recovery settings>>
- <<modules-cluster,Cluster-level shard allocation settings>>
- <<index-modules-allocation,Index-level shard allocation settings>>, including <<delayed-allocation,delayed allocation>> and <<recovery-prioritization,index recovery prioritization>> 

Shard recovery operations also respect general shard allocation settings. 

===== Monitor shard recovery

You can use the following APIs to monitor shard allocation:

 - View a list of in-progress and completed recoveries using the <<cat-recovery,cat recovery API>>
 - View detailed information about a specific recovery using the <<indices-recovery,index recovery API>>

==== Shard relocation

Shard relocation is the process of moving shards from one node to another. This can happen when a node joins or leaves the cluster, or when the cluster is rebalancing.

When a shard is relocated, it is created as a new replica shard on the target node. When the shard is fully allocated and recovered, the old shard is deleted. If the shard being relocated is a primary shard, then the new shard is marked as primary before the old shard is deleted.

===== Adjust shard relocation settings

You can control how and when shards are relocated. For example, you can adjust the rebalancing settings that control when shards are relocated to balance the cluster, or the high watermark for disk-based shard allocation that can trigger shard relocation. These settings are part of the <<modules-cluster,cluster-level shard allocation settings>>.

Shard relocation operations also respect shard allocation and recovery settings.
