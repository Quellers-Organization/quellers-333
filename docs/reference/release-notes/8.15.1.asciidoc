=== Known issues
* ES|QL queries can cause nodes to crash due to Out Of Memory errors under some circumstances when there are many indices matching the pattern,
many conflicting field mappings in those indices, and many of those fields are kept in the request.Lower memory proportional to all of that
makes it worse. (issue: {es-issue}111964[#111964], {es-issue}111358[#111358]).
Either downgrade to 8.14, upgrade to 8.15.2 upon release, or else follow the recommendation in the manual to
[disable ES|QL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/esql-kibana.html#esql-kibana-enable) queries.
