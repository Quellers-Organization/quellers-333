=== Known issues
* When upgrading clusters with non-master-eligible nodes in them from versions before 8.13, information on new functionality
of the upgraded nodes may not be registered properly with the master. This can lead to some new functionality
added since 8.13.0 not being accessible on the upgraded cluster. The workaround is to perform a rolling restart
on the non-master-eligible nodes once the upgrade is complete. This is only necessary when upgrading from a version
prior to 8.13.0.
