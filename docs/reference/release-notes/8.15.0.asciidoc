=== Known issues

* Due to a memory leak in pytorch 2.1.2, the `pytorch_inference` process running on Machine Learning nodes can consume
large amounts of memory. The OS Out of Memory Killer will kill the `pytorch_inference`
process to reclaim memory after the process exceeds a certain threshold.
This can cause inference requests to fail. Elasticsearch will automatically restart the `pytorch_inference` process
after it is killed up to four times in 24 hours. (issue: {es-issue}110530[#110530])
