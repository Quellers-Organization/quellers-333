A cluster can contain multiple copies of a shard. Each shard has one distinguished 
shard copy called the *primary*, and zero or more non-primary copies called 
*replicas*. The primary shard copy serves as the main entry point for all indexing
operations. The operations on the primary shard copy are then forwarded to its replicas.

Replicas maintain redundant copies of your data across the  <<modules-node,nodes>>,
in your cluster, protecting against hardware failure and increasing capacity to 
serve read requests like searching or retrieving a document.
