There are two types of shards: primaries and replicas. Each document in an index
belongs to one primary shard. A replica shard is a copy of a primary shard.
Replicas provide redundant copies of your data to protect against hardware
failure and increase capacity to serve read requests
like searching or retrieving a document.
